Most people go about getting a job at a startup the wrong way—and there’s not a lot of good information out there on how startup hiring actually works. I’ve seen people struggle to land startup jobs simply because they were following traditional job-hunting advice, which doesn’t always apply to early-stage companies.

I want to share three key insights that helped me land a job at a venture-backed startup—even though I didn’t have startup experience, and I didn’t even apply online.

**1\. How to Think About Startup Hiring**

If you’ve only ever applied to corporate jobs, you probably expect a structured hiring process. Big companies have established pipelines—HR screens resumes, recruiters look for “target candidates,” and every step follows a predictable process.

Startups? Completely different game.

There’s no strict hiring process. It’s often improvisational—founders and hiring managers are overwhelmed with work, and when they realize they need help, they need someone now.

This means:

• The hiring process is flexible, often changing based on who applies rather than rigid job descriptions.

• Many startups hire based on potential rather than just credentials.

• If you can prove you can do the work, you don’t necessarily need the “perfect” background.

A startup hire isn’t about checking a box—it’s about finding someone who can help the company move forward right away. That works to your advantage if you approach it the right way.

**2\. Who You Are Matters More Than Your Resume**

At a big company, your resume is everything—it gets screened by ATS systems, compared against hundreds of other applicants, and determines whether you even get an interview.

At a startup? It’s just one piece of the puzzle.

Here’s the thing about resumes: They don’t actually tell you much about a person. They list job titles, bullet points, and skills—but they don’t show who you are, how you work, or whether you’d be a great fit for a startup environment.

Startups value:

* Self-starters who don’t need hand-holding  
* People who can wear multiple hats and adapt as the company grows  
* Problem solvers who take initiative, not just follow instructions

If you want to work at a startup, don’t let your resume dictate your opportunities. You might not check all the boxes on a job description, but if you can demonstrate your skills, initiative, and adaptability, that matters way more than what’s written on your LinkedIn profile.

**3\. Be Creative to Get Noticed**

This is where startup hiring gets fun—or terrifying, depending on how you look at it.

At big corporations, recruiters handle hiring, and most employees aren’t actively looking for new team members. At a startup? Everyone is paying attention to potential hires. That means you have way more opportunities to stand out—if you’re willing to be creative.

Some ways to do this:

I. Reach Out Directly (This is what I did\!)

Don’t just send a generic application into the void. Find the CEO’s or hiring manager’s email, craft a short, thoughtful message, and explain why you’d be a great fit. Be specific. Show that you’ve actually researched the company.

This worked for me. The company I now work for had posted for a Head of Marketing role. I didn’t have enough experience to be a Head of Marketing, but I had marketing experience, and that was good enough. After he responded and we chatted via Zoom, he basically made a position for me and hired me for it. Boom.

II. Engage With Their Content

Startups often have small, tight-knit teams, and they notice who interacts with their brand online. If they have a social media presence, show up in the comments, share their content, and make yourself known. When you eventually apply, you won’t be a stranger.

III. Solve a Problem for Them

This is one of the most underrated ways to land a startup job. If you notice a startup’s website is outdated, their marketing could be better, or their sales emails need work—fix it.

Make a better landing page, write a stronger sales pitch, or do something tangible that proves your value. Then send it to them with a short note saying, *“Hey, I noticed this and took the liberty of improving it. I’d love to help your team—let me know if you’re hiring.”*

Startups are busy and understaffed. If you eliminate work for them instead of creating more, they’ll take notice.

**Final Thoughts**

Startup hiring is messy, fast-moving, and relationship-driven. If you approach it like a traditional corporate job hunt, you’ll likely get frustrated.

But if you:

* Take initiative  
* Prove your value  
* Reach out directly

—you’ll put yourself ahead of 95% of other applicants.

The best startup jobs aren’t always posted. The people who get hired are the ones who show up, solve problems, and make it impossible for the company to ignore them.

So don’t wait for permission. Just go for it.
