The author helps explain various experiences in life, such as why people get weird when the topic of money comes up or how ""Free!"" influences our thinking. Would recommend if interested in psychology or behavioral economics. "
"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet’s Nest (Millennium, #3)",Stieg Larsson,030726999X,5,2021/11/27,"Great finish to the trilogy. More action-packed and dramatic than the previous. Salander, Blomkvist, Berger, and others are just as compelling in this story. I’d say it’s the best of the three. "

Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World,Cal Newport,1455586692,5,2021/10/18,"A pathway for higher productivity, better habits, quality work product, and a more fulfilling life. ""Deep work"" is another way of saying ""focused attention, concentration, or deliberate practice. Prolonged mental effort on a singular project with zero distraction yields results. The best way to do so is to schedule it, make it a habit, practice, and disconnect from social media, email, and the other nonsense that is disrupting your mental flow. <br/><br/>Great book. I am the type of person that thrives when I ""go deep."" A library that is dead silent is my ideal study spot. I am really going to take the message of this book to heart. "
Salt to the Sea,Ruta Sepetys,,5,2021/10/13,"A great and moving story. A page-turner with an emotional ending. Kudos to the author for taking a different approach to a topic as widely covered as World War II; not only did she expose the events surrounding the Wilhelm Gustloff, she did so through the eyes of young people/teenagers. A must-read for any person (young or old) who enjoys World War II historical fiction. <br/><br/>TIP: Read the author's note at the end as well! Sepetys has some excellent thoughts and a worthwhile message. "

The Obstacle Is the Way: The Timeless Art of Turning Trials into Triumph,Ryan Holiday,1591846358,4,2021/09/23,"""First, see clearly. Next, act correctly. Finally, endure and accept the world as it is.""<br/><br/>This book offers a corrective lens for one's own outlook on life. Instead of being a superficial, anxious, depressed, self-obsessed type of person, you could alternatively change your relationship with the world, and ultimately, yourself. <br/><br/>Perception (John Rockefeller): Don't get emotional and worked up. Just see things for what they are and don't complain. Be present and think deeply. <br/><br/>Action (Demosthenes): Get started and establish a great process. Do whatever you are doing to the best of your ability and do NOT give up. Adapt. Things aren't going to work the first time. Or the second. <br/><br/>Will (Abraham Lincoln): Be disciplined and persevere. Smile no matter what happens, because life is too short and there is something to smile about and look forward to, always. Love your community and the body outside of yourself, because in the grand scheme, you aren't going to be around all that long. Make the best of it, while you can, with what you have. <br/><br/>This book is repetitive and can be a bit rah-rah, but the message is there and many desperately need to hear it. If nothing else, I gained a little bit more perspective and courage from this short book."

Missing Microbes: How the Overuse of Antibiotics Is Fueling Our Modern Plagues,Martin J. Blaser,0805098100,4,2021/09/01,"Blaser’s three pillars throughout the book:<br/><br/>1. The various bacteria and microorganisms that exist in and around the human species play a vital role in human health and well-being.<br/><br/>2. The blanket approach to prescribing antibiotics and increasing rates of procedures like the C-section are contributing to a growing public health crisis concerning antibiotic-resistant infections and diminished immunity and health amongst younger people. <br/><br/>3. The role of our microbiomes in our health is a growing field with many areas of research. These attempts include pinpointing what microorganisms are helpful (and harmful) to our health, how to restore microbiota in people who were previously deficient, and improving treatments and outcomes without traditional antibiotics.<br/><br/>Good read, but skipped a few chapters in the middle where he discusses his specific research on particular topics."
Show Your Work!: 10 Ways to Share Your Creativity and Get Discovered,Austin Kleon,076117897X,5,2021/08/29,"Great practical and insightful tips about connecting with others and celebrating the work we do every day. <br/><br/>1. You don’t have to be a genius - “Geniuses” are really just people who have poured themselves into their craft and been noticed for it.<br/><br/>2. Process, not product - speaks for itself. It’s the process that lasts.<br/><br/>3. Share something small every day<br/><br/>4. Open up your “cabinet of curiosities” - be your authentic self and show that to people. Don’t be someone you’re not.<br/><br/>5. Tell good stories - Way too much to write about this one. See Donald Miller’s book.<br/><br/>6. Teach what you know - a point of connection and a way to learn for yourself<br/><br/>7. Don’t turn into human spam - share but be self-aware.<br/><br/>8. Learn to take a punch - the more you are criticized, the more it doesn’t hurt, because it’s not personal.<br/><br/>9. Sell Out - don’t be afraid to monetize, duh.<br/><br/>10. Stick around - it’s not over until you quit. Seriously. "
A Million Miles in a Thousand Years: What I Learned While Editing My Life,Donald Miller,0785213066,5,2021/08/28,"The power of good story. How we view our lives and why we should aspire to “live a good story.” There were strong Christian themes throughout, which were a pleasant surprise. <br/><br/>*God’s way of saying, “live a good story, bring someone along with you, and let me help.”"
The Premonition: A Pandemic Story,Michael   Lewis,0393881555,4,2021/08/26,"Failure of our institutions and courage of individuals to oppose the status quo. Good narrative about the state of public health, the response to the pandemic, and the ability of driven people to influence policy, even when the odds are completely stacked against them."
