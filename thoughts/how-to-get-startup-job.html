    <h1>How to Actually Get a Job at a Startup</h1>
    
    <p>
      Most people go about getting a job at a startup the wrong way—and there's not a lot of good 
      information out there on how startup hiring actually works. I've seen people struggle to land 
      startup jobs simply because they were following traditional job-hunting advice, which doesn't 
      always apply to early-stage companies.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I want to share three key insights that helped me land a job at a venture-backed startup—even 
      though I didn't have startup experience, and I didn't even apply online.
    </p>

    <h2>1. How to Think About Startup Hiring</h2>
    
    <p>
      If you've only ever applied to corporate jobs, you probably expect a structured hiring process. 
      Big companies have established pipelines—HR screens resumes, recruiters look for "target candidates," 
      and every step follows a predictable process.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Startups? Completely different game.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      There's no strict hiring process. It's often improvisational—founders and hiring managers are 
      overwhelmed with work, and when they realize they need help, they need someone now.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This means:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>The hiring process is flexible, often changing based on who applies rather than rigid job descriptions.</li>
      <li>Many startups hire based on potential rather than just credentials.</li>
      <li>If you can prove you can do the work, you don't necessarily need the "perfect" background.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      A startup hire isn't about checking a box—it's about finding someone who can help the company 
      move forward right away. That works to your advantage if you approach it the right way.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Who You Are Matters More Than Your Resume</h2>
    
    <p>
      At a big company, your resume is everything—it gets screened by ATS systems, compared against 
      hundreds of other applicants, and determines whether you even get an interview.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      At a startup? It's just one piece of the puzzle.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Here's the thing about resumes: They don't actually tell you much about a person. They list job 
      titles, bullet points, and skills—but they don't show who you are, how you work, or whether 
      you'd be a great fit for a startup environment.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Startups value:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Self-starters who don't need hand-holding</li>
      <li>People who can wear multiple hats and adapt as the company grows</li>
      <li>Problem solvers who take initiative, not just follow instructions</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      If you want to work at a startup, don't let your resume dictate your opportunities. You might 
      not check all the boxes on a job description, but if you can demonstrate your skills, initiative, 
      and adaptability, that matters way more than what's written on your LinkedIn profile.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Be Creative to Get Noticed</h2>
    
    <p>
      This is where startup hiring gets fun—or terrifying, depending on how you look at it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      At big corporations, recruiters handle hiring, and most employees aren't actively looking for 
      new team members. At a startup? Everyone is paying attention to potential hires. That means you 
      have way more opportunities to stand out—if you're willing to be creative.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Some ways to do this:
    </p>

    <h3>I. Reach Out Directly (This is what I did!)</h3>
    
    <p>
      Don't just send a generic application into the void. Find the CEO's or hiring manager's email, 
      craft a short, thoughtful message, and explain why you'd be a great fit. Be specific. Show that 
      you've actually researched the company.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This worked for me. The company I now work for had posted for a Head of Marketing role. I didn't 
      have enough experience to be a Head of Marketing, but I had marketing experience, and that was 
      good enough. After he responded and we chatted via Zoom, he basically made a position for me 
      and hired me for it. Boom.
    </p>

    <h3>II. Engage With Their Content</h3>
    
    <p>
      Startups often have small, tight-knit teams, and they notice who interacts with their brand 
      online. If they have a social media presence, show up in the comments, share their content, 
      and make yourself known. When you eventually apply, you won't be a stranger.
    </p>

    <h3>III. Solve a Problem for Them</h3>
    
    <p>
      This is one of the most underrated ways to land a startup job. If you notice a startup's website 
      is outdated, their marketing could be better, or their sales emails need work—fix it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Make a better landing page, write a stronger sales pitch, or do something tangible that proves 
      your value. Then send it to them with a short note saying, <em>"Hey, I noticed this and took 
      the liberty of improving it. I'd love to help your team—let me know if you're hiring."</em>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Startups are busy and understaffed. If you eliminate work for them instead of creating more, 
      they'll take notice.
    </p>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    
    <p>
      Startup hiring is messy, fast-moving, and relationship-driven. If you approach it like a 
      traditional corporate job hunt, you'll likely get frustrated.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      But if you:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Take initiative</li>
      <li>Prove your value</li>
      <li>Reach out directly</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      —you'll put yourself ahead of 95% of other applicants.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The best startup jobs aren't always posted. The people who get hired are the ones who show up, 
      solve problems, and make it impossible for the company to ignore them.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      So don't wait for permission. Just go for it.
