    <h1>My Take on the Value of College</h1>
    
    <p>
      If you're in high school wondering whether college is actually worth it—or if you're a parent 
      questioning whether it makes sense to pay rising tuition costs—this is for you.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I graduated from a <strong>top 25 university</strong> a few years ago, and looking back, 
      I've realized that most people don't consider everything that goes into making such a huge 
      decision. College <strong>is valuable</strong>, but probably <strong>not in the way most 
      people frame it</strong>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      So, for students and parents who have real doubts about the college experience, let's break 
      it down. There are <strong>four key areas of value</strong> that college provides, and each 
      one should be considered in the decision-making process.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Academic Value – The Most Overrated Part of College</h2>
    
    <p>
      This is what most people think of when they hear "college"—the classes, professors, exams, 
      and homework. And while academics matter, I'd argue that this is actually the most 
      commoditized part of college.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If you're going into a field like medicine, engineering, or accounting, then yes, the 
      academic value is critical. But for most other degrees—business, media, arts—it's less 
      about what you learn and more about how you use what you learn.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      When I started college, I had great grades and extracurriculars. I was fully expecting to 
      major in biochemistry, go to medical school like others in my family, and become a doctor. 
      That obviously didn't happen.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      And honestly? A lot of what I learned in class could've been learned elsewhere. I took 
      calculus in high school, but because my credits weren't accepted at Notre Dame, I had to 
      retake it. And it was <strong>the exact same class</strong>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This is why I say academic value isn't the most important part of college. The curriculum 
      in many subjects is interchangeable across different schools, and in today's world, much 
      of it can be learned online for free.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Social Intelligence & Life Skills</h2>
    
    <p>
      This is where college <strong>really</strong> starts to provide value.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      For most people, college is the <strong>first time they have to be fully responsible for 
      themselves</strong>—getting to class on time, living with roommates, making their own 
      schedules, and figuring out life.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I remember my freshman year feeling almost overwhelmed by how much <strong>freedom</strong> 
      I suddenly had. My parents were 400 miles away, and for the first time, I could 
      <strong>do whatever I wanted</strong>. That was exciting—but also uncomfortable.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      You have to juggle academics, friendships, health, and daily life <strong>all at once</strong>, 
      and that learning curve forces you to grow.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Beyond that, there's the constant social learning—dealing with professors, handling group 
      projects, resolving conflicts, making friends, and <strong>navigating real-world problems</strong> 
      like what to do when your car breaks down and you have no idea who to call.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      These experiences <strong>build emotional intelligence</strong> in ways that textbooks never 
      will. If you skip college, you'll need to find another way to develop these skills—whether 
      through work, travel, or other structured experiences. But the reality is, 
      <strong>college gives you all of it in one place</strong> with enough structure and support 
      to not be completely overwhelming—and you'll probably have a lot more fun along the way.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Networking & Future Opportunities</h2>
    
    <p>
      College isn't just about what you learn—it's about <strong>who you meet</strong>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      You'll meet future startup founders, executives, doctors, professional athletes, and even 
      celebrities. Maybe you'll meet all of them. Maybe you'll meet none. But either way, 
      <strong>your surface area for opportunity expands massively</strong>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Some of the people I met in college were absolutely insane. I met billionaires, politicians, 
      Fortune 500 executives—all through casual social circles. Not because I was chasing networking 
      events, but because I happened to hang out with their kids, and through them, I met their parents.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      To be clear, you don't have to meet the next billionaire or pro athlete for networking to be 
      valuable. The key point is that college gives you an environment where it's easier than ever 
      to build relationships that can impact your career and life.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      And let's not forget the friendships. The people you meet in college often become lifelong 
      friends, and that's something you can't really put a price on.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Self-Discovery & Personal Growth</h2>
    
    <p>
      This is probably the most <strong>underrated</strong> part of college.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      College forces you to figure out who you are—what you care about, what kind of work excites 
      you, what kind of people you want to surround yourself with. Some people discover new passions, 
      switch career paths, or gain an entirely new perspective on life just from their college experiences.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      For me, college wasn't just about personal growth—it's also where I met my future wife. And 
      honestly? If you're looking for a partner who shares your values and life experiences, 
      <strong>college is one of the best opportunities you'll ever have</strong>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      You can absolutely grow and self-discover outside of college. But if you choose an alternative 
      path, you need to be intentional about creating those experiences, because they won't happen 
      automatically.
    </p>

    <h2>The Elephant in the Room: Cost</h2>
    
    <p>
      There's no way around it—<strong>college is too expensive</strong>. Tuition has skyrocketed 
      beyond reason, and the cost of attendance is becoming harder to justify.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      But I think the real mistake is seeing college as a money-making machine that guarantees 
      success. It doesn't.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      A better way to think about it? <strong>College is a service, not simply an investment.</strong>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      It gives you access to <strong>structured learning, opportunities, people, and experiences</strong>. 
      What you get out of it depends entirely on how you use those things.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If you take full advantage of what college offers, it can be an amazing investment. But if 
      you just coast through, skip classes, party every weekend, and graduate without any real 
      development, then yeah, it was a waste of money.
    </p>

    <h2>So, Should You Go to College?</h2>
    
    <p>
      That's up to you.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Hopefully, this breakdown helps you evaluate <strong>your own situation</strong> based on the 
      <strong>four realms of value</strong>:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Academic Learning</strong> – Somewhat overrated, especially for non-technical majors.</li>
      <li><strong>Social Intelligence & Life Skills</strong> – Critical for personal development.</li>
      <li><strong>Networking & Future Opportunities</strong> – Expands your connections and career potential.</li>
      <li><strong>Self-Discovery & Growth</strong> – Helps shape who you are and what you want in life.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      If you decide college isn't right for you, that's completely fine. But I strongly recommend 
      having a structured alternative—something that challenges you just as much, if not more.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Dr. Jordan Peterson said something interesting on this topic:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <em>"If you're questioning whether college is for you, choose an alternative that is equally 
      or more difficult."</em>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      That could be working a demanding job, starting a business, traveling, or anything that forces 
      you to grow. You could even take a gap year to test an alternative before committing.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      But for most people? College does provide immense value—it's just the <strong>cost</strong> 
      that determines whether it's right for you or not.
    </p>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    
    <p>
      The college decision isn't black and white. It's not a scam, and it's not a guaranteed ticket 
      to success. It all comes down to how you use the experience.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If you're on the fence, I'd suggest evaluating each of the four value areas and seeing if the 
      schools you're considering justify the cost. And if they don't? Make sure you have a real 
      alternative plan.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      At the end of the day, it's your life. Make the decision that actually makes sense for you.
