### Starbucks Holds More Customer Funds Than Many Banks

I learned this incredible fact while listening to this terrific Acquired podcast episode: **Starbucks holds more prepaid customer funds than a vast majority of banks in America.**

Even casual Starbucks drinkers know that the Seattle-based chain is big on their gift cards and pre-loading funds onto their mobile app. Customers get higher rewards for using pre-loaded funds vs. a standard credit or debit card, so long as you're willing to part with the minimum $10 card reload amount.

This seems like a small detail to most customers (I personally find it annoying), but once I got the whole picture, it made perfect sense. Starbucks isnâ€™t a financial institution, meaning it doesn't have to deal with any of the regulatory crap that banks and insurance companies do. And turns out, $10 added to a Starbucks account here and there adds up: Starbucks reported **$1.77 billion in cash from customer prepaid funds** at the end of fiscal year 2024\.  

In fact, Starbucks actually counts "breakage" as a revenue stream \- money that is preloaded but never actually spent. This totals hundreds of millions in free profit. The company can use that money to cover other costs, invest in new locations or equipment, pay bonuses, etc.

Incredible. So whenever you load up your next $10 onto your Starbucks app, know that their finance team is silently thanking you for being a generous micro-banker \- one who expects only coffee in return.
